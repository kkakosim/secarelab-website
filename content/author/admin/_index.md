Dr. Kakosimosâ€™ main research activities are focused on the development and application of the tools needed to improve and sustain the quality of the environment with expertise in the area of transport and reacting phenomena modelling (experimental and numerical). More specifically, my research deals with fluid mechanics, modelling/monitoring of air quality, risk analysis and effects estimation of fires, explosions and toxic gases, and solar photo- and thermochemical processes, reactors and materials. In 2014, he established the Sustainable Energy and Clean Air Research lab (SECAReLab) with unique facilities for the development and testing of solar-driven chemical processes and the involved equipment and materials. In addition, he develops software for mixed/augmented reality applications on training and safety. 
In the past, he worked as Postdoctoral Research Fellow/Assistant in the Laboratory of Thermophysical Properties and Environmental Processes of Aristotle University, as visiting Research Assistant in the National Environmental Research Institute, Aarhus University Denmark and also as a Design Engineer and Environmental Consultant for a number of private firms (Hellenic Petroleum, Titan Cement Company SA, Hellenic Gold, HYETOS GP etc). On October 2012 he has been appointed Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering in Texas A&M University at Qatar and promoted to Associate Professor on September 2018.
